# build-util #

This folder contains useful scripts for viewing and deploying the static website documentation:

* `copy-to-co-dnr-gcp.bat` - build site and copy MkDocs `site` files to State's GCP project (**limited functionality**)
* `copy-to-co-dnr-gcp.sh` - build site and copy MkDocs `site` files to State's GCP project (**preferred**)
* `run-mkdocs-serve-8001.sh` - run `mkdocs serve` to view the website locally

The following scripts in the `old` folder are no longer used but are kept around for legacy purposes:

* `copy-to-owf-amazon-s3.bat` - copy developer documentation to the Open Water Foundation website for public access
* `copy-to-owf-amazon-s3.sh` - copy developer documentation to the Open Water Foundation website for public access
