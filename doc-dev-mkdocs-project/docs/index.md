# Learn StateCU (for Software Developers)

This documentation is the developer manual for Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) StateCU consumptive use model software.

If you are reading this documentation, you have an interest in learning how StateCU is designed
and perhaps wish to contribute software code enhancements or otherwise provide input to the project.
This documentation is intended to provide sufficient information to software developers
to streamline understanding of the StateCU code and developer environment.
It is expected that software developers are technically competant and
follow conventions of the open source StateCU project.

**This documentation is a work in progress and will contain notes for inserts until resources can
be devoted to filling in blanks.**

## Colorado's Decision Support Systems

Colorado's Decision Support Systems ([CDSS, cdss.state.co.us](http://cdss.state.co.us))
has been developed to answer important questions about Colorado's water resources.
CDSS efforts are led by the [Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)](http://cwcb.state.co.us)
and [Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)](http://water.state.co.us).

One component of CDSS is the StateCU consumptive use model, which estimates irrigation water requirements and other demands.
StateCU results are used as input to the StateMod water allocation model.

In late 2016, the Open Water Foundation began the effort to move StateCU and other CDSS software to open source licensing
and establish open source software projects, and this documentation is one project outcome.

## Open Water Foundation

The Open Water Foundation (OWF, [openwaterfoundation.org](http://openwaterfoundation.org)) is a 501(c)3 social enterprise
nonprofit that focuses on developing and supporting open source software to make better
decisions about water resources.  OWF is providing technical resources and management to
transition StateCU and other CDSS software to a sustainable open source project.

## How to Use this Documentation

This website is intended as a companion to the StateCU source code and is the source of
information for software developers that support and enhance StateCU.

The documentation is organized somewhat chronologically for creating and maintaining the StateCU software.
New developers should refer to the [New Developer](dev-new/overview/) documentation.
