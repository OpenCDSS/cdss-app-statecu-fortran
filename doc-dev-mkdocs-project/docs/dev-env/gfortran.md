This documentation contains the following sections:

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Install `gfortran`](#install-gfortran)
	+ [Linux](#linux)
	+ [Windows - Cygwin](#windows-cygwin)
	+ [Windows - MinGW](#windows-mingw)

--------------------

## Prerequisites

On Windows, either [MinGW](machine#install-mingw-native-windows-32-bit) or [Cygwin](machine#install-cygwin) must have been installed.
The initial focus of this documentation is the MinGW approach.

## Install `gfortran`

The `gfortran` compiler is installed differently depending on the operating system, as described below.

### Linux

This section will be completed when resources are available for Linux development and testing.

### Windows - Cygwin

This section will be completed when resources are available for Cygwin development and testing.

### Windows - MinGW

The `gfortran` compiler is installed as part of the [MinGW installation](machine#install-mingw).
