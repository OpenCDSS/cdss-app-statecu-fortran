# Initial Project Setup / Documentation, Developer (MkDocs)

A MkDocs project was initially created outside the Git repository in order to document initial project setup.
That documentation was then copied into the following folder, to be further maintained with the StateCU code:
`~/cdss-dev/StateCU/git-repos/cdss-app-statecu-fortran/doc-dev-mkdocs-project`.

See the [Development Tasks](../dev-tasks/documenting.md) for information about using MkDocs.
