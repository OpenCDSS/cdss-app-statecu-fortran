# Initial Project Setup / Build Utility Scripts

This documentation has references a number of build utility scripts.
The default versions of these scripts have been saved in the repository to allow a new developer to directly use the scripts,
assuming that they have set up the development environment as per this documentation.
Copies of the scripts can be modified for specific developers and saved to a location specific to the user,
for example `~/cdss-dev/StateCU/build-util` (not in the repository).

This documentation includes the following sections:

* [Build Utility Script Location](#build-utility-script-location)
* [Script to Configure MinGW Environment - `setup-mingw-env`](#script-to-configure-mingw-environment-setup-mingw-env)
* [Script to Run Eclipse - `run-eclipse-statecu`](#script-to-run-eclipse-run-eclipse-statecu)

## Build Utility Script Location

The build utilities are located in the `build-util` folder in the repository.

For Linux:  `~/cdss-dev/StateCU/git-repos/cdss-app-statecu-fortran/build-util`.

For Windows:  `C:\Users\user\cdss-dev\StateCU\git-repos\cdss-app-statecu-fortran\build-util`.

## Script to Configure MinGW Environment - `setup-mingw-env`

Use this script to configure the MinGW environment so that compilers can be found in the command shell and in eclipse.
This script is called by other scripts that use the MinGW environment, such as `run-eclipse-statecu-mingw.bat`.

This script is described first in [Develompent Environment / Machine](dev-env/machine/) and is located in `build-util/mingw`.

## Script to Run Eclipse - `run-eclipse-statecu-mingw`

Use this script to start Eclipse in the MinGW environment.
This script calls `setup-mingw-env` before calling Eclipse.

This script is described first in [Initial Project Setup / Eclipse Run Script](eclipse-run-script/) and is located in `build-util/eclipse`.
