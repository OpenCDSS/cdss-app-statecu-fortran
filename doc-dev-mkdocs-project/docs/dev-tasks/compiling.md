# Development Tasks / Compiling

StateCU code is compiled using a "makefile", which defines rules for detecting when a file needs to be recompiled,
based on code dependencies.
The code can be compiled from command line or from the Eclipse IDE.
The Eclipse IDE provides benefits during development but it may be necessary or useful to compile on the command line,
for example, if automating the build process.

This documentation contains the following sections:

* [Compile StateCU on Command Line](#compile-statecu-on-command-line)
* [Compile StateCU in Eclipse](#compile-statecu-in-eclipse)

## Compile StateCU on Command Line

**TODO smalers 2017-01-01 Need to fill this out once the Git repo files are cleaned up but Jim Brannon's makefile worked with:  make -f makefile_eclipse_linux**

## Compile StateCU in Eclipse

**TODO smalers 2017-01-01 Need to describe once Eclipse project is put together**
