# Development Tasks / Troubleshooting Eclipse

**TODO smalers 2017-01-02 need to fill in some common Eclipse support items.**

>_[JHB] My issues wih Eclipse were 1. figuring out which version to download! 2. getting JAVA set up such that Eclipse would run.  I avoid the Oracle JAVA wherever possible, and instead use the open source alternatives.  3. Eclipse/JAVA issues - eventually after a month or so of working with it...it starts consuming 100% of the CPU.  Have to reinstall a clean copy of Eclipse again. 4. Meshing in a debugger - the one I finally got to work was xdebug. 5. Learning how to get it to work with git and github.  It seemed glitchy, so I quit and handled git tasks from the command line._
