# Development Tasks / Run Eclipse

The Eclipse/Photran IDE is useful for interactive code development, debugging, and testing.

This documentation contains the following sections:

* [Configure Environment](#configure-environment)
* [Start Eclipse](#start-eclipse)

## Configure Environment

The development environment must be configured properly in order for Eclipse to find the compilers and other software.

### Linux

**TODO smalers 2016-12-31 fill in when there is time to test on Linux**

### Windows

**This step is included by default if the Eclipse run script is used.**

Assuming that the development environment is consistent with this documentation, run the script from a Windows command shell:
`C:\Users\user\cdss-dev\StateCU\git-repos\cdss-app-statecu-fortran\build-util\mingw\setup-mingw-env.bat`.

## Start Eclipse

Assuming that the development environment is consistent with this documentation, run the script from a Windows command shell:
`C:\Users\user\cdss-dev\StateCU\git-repos\cdss-app-statecu-fortran\build-util\eclipse\run-eclipse-statecu-mingw.bat`.

After Eclipse starts, pick the StateCU workspace: `C:\Users\user\cdss-dev\StateCU\eclipse-workspace`.
