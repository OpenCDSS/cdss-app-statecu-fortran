This repository contains the source code for the StateCU consumptive use model,
which is part of [Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](http://cdss.state.co.us).

The StateCU software is being migrated to an open source software project as part of the OpenCDSS project
being led by the [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org).

See the following developer documentation to get started as a StateCU developer:

* [Learn StateCU (for Developers)](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-cdss-statecu-dev/index.html)

The developer documentation and guidelines will be updated as the development environment is proven out.

The lead developers for StateCU are:

* Steve Malers, Open Water Foundation, steve.malers@openwaterfoundation.org (initial author of developer documentation and architect of development environment)
* Erin Wilson, Wilson Water Group, erin.wilson@wilsonwatergroup.com (StateCU subject matter expert during transition to open source project)
